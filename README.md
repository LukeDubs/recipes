Project: Recipes from Foundations

One of the firest projects in TOP, using HTML to create a webpage with multiple linked pages.

The future plan is to add CSS and Javascript after finishing Foundations course and create a bottle "parts picker", where the user can select what drinks they already have and then be recommended recipes that they can make.
